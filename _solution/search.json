    "text": "Exercise 1: Bird abundance\nThis is the same dataset used in the lecture.\nFragmentation of forest habitat has an impact of wildlife abundance. This study looked at the relationship between bird abundance (bird ha-1) and the characteristics of forest patches at 56 locations in SE Victoria.\nThe predictor variables are:\n\nALT Altitude (m)\nYR.ISOL Year when the patch was isolated (years)\nGRAZE Grazing (coded 1-5 which is light to heavy)\nAREA Patch area (ha)\nDIST Distance to nearest patch (km)\nLDIST Distance to largest patch (km)\n\nImport the data from the “Loyn” tab in the MS Excel file.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nloyn &lt;- read_xlsx(\"mlr.xlsx\", \"Loyn\")\n\nOften, the first step in model development is to examine the data. This is a good way to get a feel for the data and to identify any issues that may need to be addressed. In this case, we will examine the data using histograms and a correlation matrix.\n\nHistograms\nThere are a breadth of ways to create histograms in R. In each tab below you will find some different ways to create the same plot outputs.\n\nhist()hist.data.frame() from Hmiscggplot()ggplot() with dplyr\n\n\nThis is a straightforward way to create multiple histograms with hist(). The par() function is used to arrange the plots on the page. The mfrow argument specifies the number of rows and columns of plots.\n\n#par(mfrow=c(3,3))\nhist(loyn$ABUND)\n\n\n\nhist(loyn$ALT)\n\n\n\nhist(loyn$YR.ISOL)\n\n\n\nhist(loyn$GRAZE)\n\n\n\nhist(loyn$AREA)\n\n\n\nhist(loyn$DIST)\n\n\n\nhist(loyn$LDIST)\n\n\n\n#par(mfrow=c(1,1))\n\n\n\nThe Hmisc package provides a function hist.data.frame() that can be used to create multiple histograms, which can be called by simply using hist(). You may need to tweak the nclass argument to get the desired number of bins, as the default may not look appropriate.\n\n# install.packages(\"Hmisc\")\nlibrary(Hmisc)\nhist(loyn, nclass = 50)\n\n\n\nA more modern approach is to use ggplot() with facet_wrap() to arrange multiple plots on a single page. To do this, the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package is used to reshape the data into a tidy format.\n\n# tidy the data\nloyn_tidy &lt;- pivot_longer(loyn, cols = everything())\n\n# plot\nggplot(loyn_tidy, aes(x = value)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  facet_wrap(~name, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we use the pipe operator %&gt;% from dplyr to chain together a series of commands. The pipe operator takes the output of the command on the left and passes it to the command on the right (or below) the pipe. This means that we can create a series of commands that are executed in order.\n\nloyn %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(cols = everything()) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = value)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  facet_wrap(~name, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nComment on the histograms in terms of leverage. Hint: what is the relationship between leverage and skewness?"

    "text": "At your own time: California streamflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis additional exercise can be done at your own time. Most of the code are provided. You will need to run the code and interpret the results.\n\n\nThe following dataset contains 43 years of annual precipitation measurements (in mm) taken at (originally) 6 sites in the Owens Valley in California. I have reduced this to three variables labelled L10APSAB (Lake Sabrina), L10OBPC (Big Pine Creek), L10OPRC (Rock Creek), and the dependent variable stream runoff volume (measured in ML/year) at a site near Bishop, California (labelled L10BSAAM). There is also a variable Year but you can ignore this.\nNote the variables have already been log-transformed to increase normality of the residuals in the regressions.\nStart with a full model and manually remove the variables one at a time, checking every time whether removal of a variable actually improves the model.\n\n# read in the data\ns.data &lt;- read_xlsx(\"mlr.xlsx\", \"California_streamflow\")\nnames(s.data)\n\n[1] \"L10APSAB\" \"L10OBPC\"  \"L10OPRC\"  \"L10BSAAM\"\n\n\n\ns.mod_full &lt;-lm(L10BSAAM~L10APSAB + L10OBPC + L10OPRC, data=s.data)\ns.mod_full &lt;-lm(L10BSAAM~., data=s.data) ## you can also use the . to indicate use all variables\nsummary(s.mod_full)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = L10BSAAM ~ ., data = s.data)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.09885 -0.03331  0.01025  0.03359  0.09495 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This involves performing Partial F-Tests as discussed in the lecture.\nThis can be done in R by using anova() on two model objects. To be able to compare the models and run the anova, you need to make objects of all the possible model combinations you want to compare.\n\ns.mod_reduced &lt;- lm(L10BSAAM ~ L10OPRC + L10OBPC, data=s.data)\nanova(s.mod_reduced, s.mod_full)\n\nThe last row gives the results of the partial F-test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\n\nShould we remove L10APSAB from the model?"
